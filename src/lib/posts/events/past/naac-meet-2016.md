## About

CMI underwent a mandatory accreditation process through the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), with the evaluation visit taking place from April 19-21, 2016. As part of this process, CMI aimed to present information about the post-CMI careers of its alumni to the NAAC team. A special session was organized on April 19, where alumni and parents had the opportunity to interact with the NAAC team. Alumni were also encouraged to share brief summaries of their career paths, particularly those outside academia.

## Result

CMI was accredited with an "A" grade by NAAC for a period of five years starting in May 2016. Appreciation was extended to all alumni who contributed by submitting their career summaries and attending the NAAC teamâ€™s visit.
