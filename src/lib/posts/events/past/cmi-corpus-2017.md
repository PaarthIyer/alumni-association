## Appeal for Alumni Contributions

On September 11, 2017, Professor C.S. Seshadri, Director-Emeritus of CMI, reached out to alumni, emphasizing the institution's academic excellence and its growing reputation in Mathematics, Computer Science, and Physics. He highlighted the significance of alumni contributions in supporting leading institutions worldwide and urged former students to play a similar role in CMI’s growth. Due to challenges in securing government funding, he appealed for donations to the CMI corpus, suggesting contributions of $1500 or Rs 1,00,000, either as a single payment or through annual installments. Alumni were encouraged to share this request with others who might be interested in supporting CMI.

## Tax Exemption and Payment Details

Following the appeal, on September 13, 2017, Mr. S. Sripathy provided details regarding tax exemptions and bank account information for routing donations. This ensured that contributors could make informed financial decisions while supporting the institute.

## Positive Response and Follow-Up

By October 12, 2017, CMI had received a strong response to the call for contributions. Krishna, in a follow-up message, expressed gratitude for the support and made a request for donors to notify Mr. Sripathy and Ms. Ranjini Girish about their transactions. This was necessary to accurately identify and acknowledge donors, as some deposits lacked sufficient details.

The enthusiastic response from alumni underscored their commitment to CMI’s future and reinforced the role of alumni support in sustaining academic excellence.
