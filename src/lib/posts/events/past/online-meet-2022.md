## About

On November 24, 2022, the CMI Alumni Association hosted a Zoom catch-up to reconnect with alumni and get the ball rolling on alumni activities again. It had been a while since the last official meeting, so this was a great opportunity to bring everyone together, hear ideas, and figure out how to keep the association active. There was no set agenda—just an open space for conversation, brainstorming, and planning what comes next.

## Event Summary

The Zoom meet saw a lively turnout, with around 50 alumni joining in. The session kicked off with introductions and casual conversations, allowing attendees to reconnect and share personal and professional updates. Madhavan then provided an overview of recent developments at CMI, including the expansion of academic programs, the addition of new faculty members, student growth, and infrastructure developments such as the acquisition of new land within SIPCOT, the FC Kohli Centre, and collaborations with BIRS.

After the updates, the conversation naturally shifted towards the role of the alumni association and how to strengthen its impact. Participants shared personal experiences about their transition from CMI to the next phases of their careers and discussed the importance of a structured alumni support network. The discussion touched upon ways to foster stronger ties between alumni and current students, improve communication, and create meaningful opportunities for collaboration.

Many participants emphasized the need for more regular alumni interactions, both online and in person. The idea of hosting alumni talks and mentorship programs was floated, where alumni could guide students on career choices, research opportunities, and industry insights. The group also explored the potential for an alumni newsletter or blog to keep everyone updated on community activities.

## Key Takeaways

Some exciting ideas came out of the discussion, including:

- **Alumni Support Forum:** A platform where alumni can share advice and experiences about moving to new cities, switching jobs, applying for visas, or exploring higher studies. Young alumni have volunteered to set this up.
- **Better Communication Channels:** The idea of starting an alumni WhatsApp or Telegram group to keep conversations going.
- **Alumni Funding:** Instead of scattered donations, a single pooled fund was suggested, so contributions could be used flexibly for things like travel grants or student needs.
- **Alumni Roundtable:** A dedicated space (online or in-person) where alumni can connect with current students and share career insights.
- **New Leadership:** The need to elect new office bearers for the association in an upcoming meeting.
- **Alumni Talks and Mentorship:** A proposal to organize talks by alumni in different career paths to guide current students.
- **Alumni Newsletter/Blog:** A potential platform to keep alumni engaged with updates, interviews, and community highlights.
- **In-Person Alumni Meet:** There was strong interest in holding a face-to-face alumni gathering at CMI, so a poll was created to find a suitable date.

## In-Person Alumni Meet

After gathering votes, the in-person meet was set for **January 14-15, 2023** at CMI. Alumni were encouraged to confirm their attendance, and efforts were made to accommodate as many as possible in the guesthouse. The announcement was shared widely to ensure everyone got the chance to join.

The Zoom session was a great way to reconnect and spark ideas, and it’s clear that there’s a lot of enthusiasm for keeping the alumni network active. With an in-person meet now on the horizon, there’s plenty to look forward to!
