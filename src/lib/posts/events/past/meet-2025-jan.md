## Summary

[Click here for the image gallery](/gallery/jan_2025_meet)

1. The official registration process of the alumni association is underway. As part of this process, we will need to submit a list of all the members. During the alumni meet, we spent some time creating a file with a list of all the members.

2. Going forward the alumni association will have two in-person meetings every year:

    - First Saturday of August after the odd semester begins in CMI and

    - First Saturday after Pongal in January.

    So the next two meetings will be on August 9, 2025 and January 17, 2026. Please plan accordingly!

3. Next year will be the 25th anniversary of the first B.Sc batch of CMI graduating (in 2001). We plan to commemorate this occasion in one of the future meetings. More details to be fixed in due course.

4. We have a WhatsApp group for all CMI alumni. Expanded to a community now with a job search group as well.
