## Key Discussions

A major focus of the meet was on strengthening the alumni association and improving communication among members. There was a discussion about creating dedicated channels, such as a forum or messaging groups, to facilitate regular updates and collaboration. Ensuring that alumni remain connected with the institution and each other was seen as a priority.

Another important topic was the establishment of mentorship and career guidance programs for students. Alumni explored ways to provide insights into various career paths, assist with job placements, and offer support for higher studies. The possibility of organizing structured mentorship programs was considered as a means to bridge the gap between past and present students.

The conversation also touched upon enhancing alumni contributions to CMI. Discussions revolved around how alumni could support the institution financially and through other means, such as guest lectures, workshops, or research collaborations. A more organized approach to alumni funding was suggested to ensure that contributions could be allocated effectively where needed.

Finally, attendees deliberated on planning future in-person and online alumni events. The goal was to ensure regular interactions that go beyond reunions, including professional networking opportunities, academic collaborations, and interactive sessions with students. The meeting laid the foundation for long-term engagement and continued efforts to strengthen the alumni network.
