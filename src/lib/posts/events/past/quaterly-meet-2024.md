## Lecture abstract

GenAI is reshaping the conversation in every board room. It is revolutionising entrepreneurship by reshaping the economy of demand. With AI driven innovation, businesses are anticipating a tectonic shift in the way they work. Even industries as traditional as cement manufacturing or newspaper printing are reimagining business. How can you grab that opportunity as an entrepreneur?
